        "Probability concerns the study of uncertainty and is often used to quanitfy uncertainty in data analysis and prediction, uncertainty in the data sciene and machine learning model. Probability is a key mathematical concept that is essential for modeling and understanding various model performance. Data science and machine learning rely heavily on probailistic models. This section will provide the necessary probability background for learning and understanding data science concepts. It will introduce the concept of probability, provide an overview of probability distribution, conditional probability, random variables, and describe how to compute expectation and variance. In addition, it includes maximum likelihood estimation. Further probability and their applications can be found in many references [6, 7, 3]."

In general, the word experiment may represent a planned or carefully controlled laboratory testing situation. In probability, we use it here in a much wider sense. Thus experiments that may be of interest include tossing a coin once or several times, selecting a card or cards from a deck, weighing a loaf of bread, ascertaining the commuting time from home to work on a particular morning, obtaining blood types from a group of individuals, or measuring blood pressues of human beings.\n",
